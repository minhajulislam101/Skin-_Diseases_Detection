Skin Diseases and the Importance of Detection Using Machine Learning

# Skin Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

Skin diseases are among the most common health issues globally, affecting millions of people. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. Traditionally, skin disease diagnosis relies heavily on visual inspection by dermatologists, which can be subjective and limited by the clinician's experience. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by automating the detection process, potentially increasing accuracy and accessibility of diagnostics. This project explores the application of various ML models, including VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, for the detection of skin diseases using dermatological images.

## Models Used
- **VGG16**
- **ResNet50**
- **MobileNetV2**
- **InceptionV3**

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-detection.git
    cd skin-disease-detection
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle Dermatology Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subirbiswas19/skin-disease-dataset/code). Ensure you place the dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.

### Running the Models

To train and test the models, you can run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
